# Profile

I have a strong enthusiasm for optimal power flow and time series data analysis. Especially I have a great interest in distributed energy source management and energy efficiency through power load prediction.
My primary goal is to create a business model that can contribute substantially to the energy sector, through gaining a deep insight from practical experiences in the artificial intelligence field.
