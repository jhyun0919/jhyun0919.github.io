ALAFF: Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization  ALAFF Git RepositoryGram–Schmidt ProcessGiven a set of linearly independent vectors $Span({ a_0, … , a_{n-1} } ) \\subset \\mathbb{C}^m$, the Gram-Schimdt process computes a new basis {$q_0, … , q_{n-1}$} that spans the same subspace as the original vectors, i.e. $Span({ a_0, … , a_{n-1} } ) = Span({ q_0, … , q_{n-1} } )$ [1].It should be noted that we would like to have the new basis, ${ q_0, … , q_{n-1} }$, having the following characteristics.  All vectors are unit vectors of length 1, i.e. $|q_i| = 1$.  All vectors are mutually perpendicular, i.e. $q_i \\perp q_j$ where $i \\neq j$.These characteristics can be obtained through the following routine which is composed by three steps [1]:  &lt;Gram-Schmidt Process&gt;  Step 1. Compute the direction of the vectors.  Step 2. Compute the magnitude of the normalizer.  Step 3. Compute a unit vector.    Compute the vector $q_0$ ($i=0$)          Step 1. Compute the direction of the vectors.                  Stpe 2. Compute the magnitude of the normalizer.                  Step 3. Compute a unit vector.                  Result            compute the vector $q_1$ ($i=1$)          Step 1. Compute the direction of the vectors.                      Step 2. Compute the magnitude of the normalizer.                  Step 3. Compute a unit vector.                  Result            compute the vector $q_2$ ($i=2$)          Step 1. Compute the direction of the vectors.                      Step 2. Compute the magnitude of the normalizer.                  Step 3. Compute a unit vector.                  Result            keep do the routine till $i=n-1$          Step 1. Compute the direction of the vectors.      Step 2. Compute the magnitude of the normalizer.      Step 3. Compute a unit vector.      Final Result      What we should pay attention to in the final result ($A = QR$) are …      All column vectors of $Q$, the new basis {$q_0, … , q_{n-1}$}, are unit vector and mutually orthogonal, which means $Q$ is an unitary matrix.        The matrix $R$ is upper triangular matrix and $rank(R)=m$.        The dot product of $Q$ and $R$, which is equal to $A$, can be regarded as a linear combination of $Q$’s column vectors.        The result of Gram-Shmidt Process can be regarded as a result of QR factorization (decomposotion).  Classical Gram-Schmidt (CGS)The content discussed in the previous section can be summarized into an algorithm as follows, which is the CGS-QR algorithm [2].Consider $A=QR$.Partition the given matrices as follows.Assume that $Q_0$ and $R_{0,0}$ have already been computed.Since $Q$ is unitary matric ($Q_0^HQ_0=I$ and $Q_0^Hq_1=0$),  $Q_0^Ha_1=Q_0^HQ_0r_{0,1}+q_1\\rho_{1,1}=r_{01}$Compute $r_{0,1}$, which is already known.  $r_{0,1}:=Q_0^Ha_1$Compute $\\rho_{1,1}$ (Step 1. &amp; 2.).  $a_1^\\perp:=a_1-Q_0r_{0,1}$  $\\rho_{1,1}:=|a_1^\\perp|$Compute $q_1$ (Step 3.).  $q_1 := a_1^\\perp / \\rho_{1,1}$Figure 1. shows Classical Gram-Schmidt algorithm for computing the QR factorization of a matrix A. The algorithm used FLAME notation.Code 1. shows the algorithms in python language.   Figure 1. Classical Gram-Schmidt algorithm for computing the QR factorization of a matrix A [2]     Code. 1: CGS QR in python  Test_CGS_QR.ipynbModified Gram-Schmidt (MGS)Gram-Schmidt process can be performed differently from CGS, and the corresponding algorithm is as follows, which is called Modified Gram-Schmidt (MGS) [3].Consider $A=QR$.Partition the given matrices as follows.Assume that $a_1$ and $A_2$ are known.Compute $\\rho_{1,1}$ (compute the magnitude).  $\\rho_{1,1}:=|a_1|$Compute $q_1$ (compute the unit vector).  $q_1:=a_1/\\rho_{1,1}$Compute $r_{0,1}^T$, which is already known.  $r_{0,1}^T:=q_1^H(A_2 - Q_2R_{22}) = q_1^HA_2$Compute $A_2$ (update $A_2$ for the orthogonality).  $A_2:=A_2-q_1r_{0,1}^T$Figure 2. shows Modified Gram-Schmidt algorithm for computing the QR factorization of a matrix A. The algorithm used FLAME notation.Code 2. shows the algorithms in python language.   Figure 2. Alternative Modified Gram-Schmidt algorithm for computing the QR factorization of a matrix A [3]     Code. 2: MGS QR in python  Test_MGS_QR.ipynbWhy do we need this?Through Gram-Schmidt process, we can obtain a orthonormal basis for $\\mathbb{C}^m$.The advantages of being able to have an orthonormal basis are following [4].      We can express any  $v \\in \\mathbb{C}^m$ as a lineawr combination of coefficients, which will allows us to have an explicit formula expressing $v$ with the orthonormal basis.        The explicit formula is very useful when dealing with projection onto subspace.  References[1] M. M.

        "content": "Recently, I have finished two final exams, and one left next Thursday. I think it is a good moment to start again to write what I have been thinking these days. Looking back at the end of the semester, I realized that a lot had happened globally, which I have not thought deeply about due to my hectic school life. For instance, the pandemic broke out, and we are living in the era of New Normal. Also, there was a presidential election in the US. In my thought, these are the most notable or significant events of this year. However, in this article, I would like to share my view about what happened in France.   (https://bdidier.fr/4eme-la-laicite/)  In October, a French middle school teacher was attacked and beheaded by a terrorist. Similar incidents have been happening after this incident, and it reminded me of the terror in Paris four years ago. Behind these tragedies, we all know there are complex religious problems. Several factors may be responsible for the continued occurrence of these incidents in France. In my respect, it has a lot to do with Laicite (Secularism).I know that it is nearly impossible for me, not French, to fully understand and describe the meaning of Laicite. To the best of my understanding, it means strict separation of religion from society, the secular world. There must be pros and cons of separating religion from our lives. I can agree that we can get an opportunity to consider religion on an equal footing with other values by taking it apart from society. For example, in Korea, many parents agree that their children can make decisions for their future by themselves. However, suddenly they change extremely conservative when it comes to religious choices, which is nonsense, given that it is just another decision like others. I think they act differently because they never take apart religion from their lives and always give a top priority to it. Suppose parents had tried to separate religion from society and consider it on an equal footing. In that case, they might have different conversations with their children and ended up with more rational conclusions.However, a series of these thoughts can be taken as a challenge or blasphemy for violent and radical religious groups. In my opinion, these groups are very likely to use violence in the form of retaliation when society becomes unstable. As a result, ironically, the society where rational judgment can be made is exposed to the risk of terror. As far as religion is concerned, I think France has a society with good conditions for making rational judgments. Simultaneously, the country is exposed to violence in an unstable period due to the pandemic. I hope they will overcome this crisis well without further tragedy, and others will be able to learn the unique way of their thinking.",

The series will be written in four articles, and the contents are as follows, and if necessary, additional posts will be uploaded as a separate series.In this article, we will show you what Git is and Why do we need it. Also, we will give a brief intro to how we can start and use Git.  Git Basic  Virtual Environment  PEP8  JupyterWhat is GitGit is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency [1]. It provides us a history of content changes and facilitates collaborative changes to files [2].   Figure 1. Examples of Using Git [3].  Why Do We Need GitWhen we work on a project and do something creative and productive, we repeat the following four steps [2].  Create things.  Save things.  Edit things.  Save the things again.By repeating the above steps, we add new things, delete unnecessary ones, request modifications, and make corrections where necessary. To make this process straightforward and efficient, we turn to the help of version control. Through the version control system, we can easily track the followings [2].  When we did it.  Why we did it.  What the contents of the change.This makes it possible to efficiently understand the project’s process and be more productive when revisiting the project in the future.For these reasons, we cannot overemphasize the necessity of version control when working on projects through collaboration as well as personal projects. By using Git, we can take these benefits of version control.   Figure 2. Workflow with Git [4].  Basic Git CommandsThe following are essential terminal commands for Git. It may be difficult to memorize, but it is good to understand only its purpose. As long as you understand each command’s purpose, you can easily use Git through a GUI, which will be covered in the following section.For reference, the contents are referred to as the following links.  Essential git commands every developer should know  Top 20 Git Commands With Examplesgit init$ git init [project-name]  This command is used to start a new repository.git clone$ git clone [url]  This command is used to obtain a repository from an existing URL.git add$ git add [file-name]  This command adds a file to the staging area.git rm$ git rm [file-name]  This command deletes the file from your working directory and stages the deletion.git commit$ git commit -m “Message to go with the commit here”  This command records or snapshots the file permanently in the version history.git status$ git status  This command lists all the files that have to be committed.git push$ git push [variable name] master  This command sends the committed changes of master branch to your remote repository.$ git push [variable name] [branch-name]  This command sends the branch commits to your remote repository.git branch$ git branch  This command lists all the local branches in the current repository.$ git branch [branch-name]  This command creates a new branch.$ git branch -d [branch-name]  This command deletes the feature branch.git checkout$ git checkout [branch-name]  This command is used to switch from one branch to another.$ git checkout -b [branch-name]  This command creates a new branch and also switches to it.git pull$ git pull [repository link]  This command fetches and merges changes on the remote server to your working directory.git merge$ git merge [branch-name]  This command merges the specified branch’s history into the current branch.git diff$ git diff  This command shows the file differences which are not yet staged.$ git diff [first branch-name] [second branch-name]  This command shows the differences between the two branches mentioned.git stash$ git stash save  This command temporarily stores all the modified tracked files.$ git stash pop  This command restores the most recently stashed files.$ git stash list  This command lists all stashed changesets.$ git stash drop  This command discards the most recently stashed changeset.GitKrakenThere is an entry barrier to use the commands described above in a terminal window. For those who have difficulty using Git in a terminal window, we suggest to use a GUI called GitKraken.

        "content": "Whenever I come back to Korea, 떡볶이 has always been the first food that I had. Briefly speaking, this food is just some rice cakes with spicy sauce. Compare to other Korean foods, 떡볶이 might seem shabby. However, this food is one of the reasons why I love and how I remember this place. Why did I pick 떡볶이 instead of other fancy dishes, and why am I so into it? I guess this is because it is my unique way of engraving memories in this country.Likewise, most people who have not grown up in this country might come up with great landmarks when they imagine Korea. However, as a born and raised person in Korea, the shape of this country in my heart is not like that. It could be the small marketplace in my old hometown, or it could be the parking lot in front of my apartment building, where I used to ride a bike and roller skates. It is kind of a secret between me and the place that I love.This pattern is identically applied to the people around me. The one who I love (or loved) is not remembered as her bright and shining moments that all the others could have seen. I memorized her in a way that no one could imagine. It does not have to be pretty or lovely. It just needs to be my little secret between her and me. These secrets comfort me and give strength, even though I can no longer be together with her.",

        "content": "Starting with the definition of the Hessian Matrix, this posting will focus on the geometric meaning of the Hessian matrix. Also, we will discuss the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Hessian and introduce the application of it.This post was written with reference to the following materials.  Donghoon Yeo’s blog posting  Wikipedia &gt; HessianHessian MatrixDefinitionIn mathematics, the Hessian matrix or Hessian is a square matrix of second-order partial derivatives of a scalar-valued function, or scalar field. It describes the local curvature of a function of many variables. [1]Suppose $f : ℝ^n → ℝ$ is a function taking as input a vector $x ∈ ℝ^n$ and outputting a scalar $f(x) ∈ ℝ$. If all second partial derivatives of $f$ exist and are continuous over the domain of the function, then the Hessian matrix $H$ of $f$ is a square n×n matrix, usually defined and arranged as follows; [1]   Figure 1. Definition of Hessian matrix. [1]  Geometric MeaningFirst of all, it is well known that all matrices can be considered as linear transformations. Likewise, we can think of a Hessian matrix as a linear transformation. Geometrically, the main feature of the linear transformation performed by the Hessian matrix is to make a given function more convex or concave.Let’s look at the Hessian’s geometric meaning in detail through examples.The Hessian matrices corresponding to Figure 2 and 3 are as follow;The things to note here are, the eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix represent the principal axis of transformation and the eigenvalues represent the degree of transformation. More specifically, if the eigenvalues are all positive (Figure 2), it makes the given function more convex. Conversely, if the eigenvalues are all negative, it makes the given function more concave. However, if some of the eigenvalues are positive, and some are negative (Figure 3), the given function is converted to a saddle shape. To recapitulate, by using the main feature of the geometric transformation shown by the Hessian, we could emphasize the gradient change of the given function.   Figure 2. Example of Hessian transform making the given function more convex. [2]     Figure 3. Example of Hessian transform making the given function to a saddle shape function. [2]  ApplicationsUsing the feature that the Hessian emphasizes the gradient change, it can be used as a filter that detects the contour (edge) of a specific object in a given image, which is considered as a function at this point. Figure 4 shows the description of edge detection and the Hessian’s eigenvalues, and Figure 5 shows an application detecting the vessel using the Hessian.   Figure 4. Edge detection using Hessian's eigenvalues [3]     Figure 5. Hessian's applicaiton: Frangi filter for vessel detection. [2]  References[1] “Hessian matrix,” Wikipedia, 24-Jun-2020. [Online].

More specifically, in order to select the type of layer used in the model, the characteristics of data features and the learning objectives of the model must be considered.In order to find out which structure is most suitable, we experimented with fixing the type of dataset and the target of the model and changing the structure of the model. The dataset used in the experiment is MNIST. The types of models used in the experiment were as follows; DenseNet using only dense layer, ConvNet using convolutional layer, and LstmNet using LSTM layer.Full code of the experiments can be found at the following github repository.  Park’s GitHub &gt; How to choose layerThis post was written with reference to the following materials.

This is the simplest model of the neural network and works well for all types of data, but performance decreases when an input data becomes complicated or large. Therefore, dense layers are used in learning simple data. In addition, in the case of learning complex data, dense layers are used in the last part of the model, which is the stage where features are extracted and get simple enough.  CNN ModelThis model consisted of convolutional layers. This model is suitable when there are spatial relationship across the data. Figure 1 depicts how a convolutional layer works, and it helps understand why this model works well when there are spatial relationship across data.     Figure 1. Visualization of how the convolutional neural network layer works [1].  RNN(LSTM) ModelThis model consisted of LSTM layers. This model is suitable when there are temporal (sequential) relationship across the data. Figure 2 depicts how a LSTM layer works, and it helps understand why this model works well when there are temporal relationship across data.     Figure 2. Visualization of how the recurrent neural network layer works [2].  Experiment ResultAs a result of the experiment, the CNN model using a convolutional layer showed the highest performance for learning MNIST image data. Direct comparison was not possible because the number of trainable parameters differed for each model, but the result was obtained by adjusting hyper-parameters to obtain the best performance for each model.To sum up, we have confirmed that it is best to use a convolutional layer when learning MNIST image data.                   Accuracy      Loss                  DenseNet      0.9556      1.5092              ConvNet      0.9817      1.4793              LstmNet      0.9603      1.5015         Figure 2. Checking the validation result with tensorboard.  Future StudyIn some cases, such as image data or stock data, we can know the nature of the feature data in advance and use the CNN or RNN layers respectively. However, it is difficult to fully understand the charactieristic of completely new feature data. In this case, it is difficult to make assumptions about the temporal/spatial relationships across the data. As a result, it is not easy to decide which layer to use.Transformer is a model designed to solve this problem. Transformer is a model based on attention, it make no assumptions about the temporal/spatial relationships across the data [3]. In the next posting, we will discuss the structure and application of the Transformer.Reference[1]I. Shafkat, “Intuitively Understanding Convolutions for Deep Learning,” Medium, 07-Jun-2018.

Load &amp; pre-process the datasetFor the experiment to show the basic process of training a model with TensorFlow, we used the MNIST dataset. The given images are a grayscale, so we need a preprocessing process to scale the image data features from 0 to 1.  2. Set a modelIn this step, we designed the structure of a model. The model in this experiment was relatively simple, so it could be easier to construct the model using tf.keras.Sequential. However, we use custumized model for the experiment. This is because a custumized model must be used when constructing a more complex model in the future, and it is necessary to become familiar with it. More specifically, in case of the model becomes complicated and the input features do not flow sequentially, the model must be constructed in a custum manner. Transformer model is a good example.  (optional) Set callbackscheckpointWe set checkpoint callback to record the training process of the model.  tensorboardWe set tensorboard callback to visualize the training process and strucutre of the model.  reduce learning rateWe set reduce-learning-rate callback for better training result of the model.  3. Compile the modelSet optimizer, loss function, &amp; metricsAfter constructing the model, you need to set the learning process by calling the compile method. Compile method has three important parameters; optimizer, loss, and metrics.The optimizer sets up the training process. The loss sets the loss function to be minimized during the optimization process. The metrics are used to monitor training. These should be set differently depending on the type of feature data and the purpose of the model.The model was compiled using the set optimizer, loss, and metrics.     4. Fit the modelWe conducted training using the preprocessed dataset and the compiled model.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)In order to train a deep learning model, the first thing to do is to explore and analyze the given dataset. In this stage, we can get some hints for designing a structure of the model. The things we have to check in EDA are following;First we need to check size and shape of feature data and target data. Based on the result, we can confirm that a proper shape of input &amp; output data for our model; Input data shape is 28 by 28 matrix (or tensor) and output is a scalar.  Second, we we have to check the value of target data. Since the target data is discrete, we can confirm that the model will be a classification model, and we will refer target as label from now on. Also, we need to check whether the distribution of labels in train and test dataset is biased or not. If dataset is biased, the model trained with this dataset will also biased. This is one of the main reason why we need to check and analyze the given dataset before build and train the model.     Figure 1. Distribution of label dataset  (Optional) Check the real image of feature data. Checking how the feature data looks like is not necessary in training and evaluating the model. However, this will allows you intuitive understanding for analyzing dataset and designing a structure of the model.     Figure 2. Plot a real image of feature dataSample image of feature data  2. Data preprocessFirst, the given dataset need to be reshaped properly. In this step, feature data need an additional dimension to use convolution layers. Also, label data need to be reshaped label encoding into one-hot-encoding for a classification model [1].Second, feature data have to be normalized [2]. Through this process, all features data are scaled to a same unit preventing from one feature dominate others.Lastly, we will use batch to control stability of the training [3]. Also, data distribution of each batches might occur bias, so train data need to be shuffled before split into batches. It is worth noting at this step that Tensorflow provides a nice feature called tf.Data to help organize the given data.  3. ModelThe model is comprised of two parts, feature extraction and classification. In the feature extraction stage, the model use two dimension convolution filter (Conv2D) since the input feature data is image data. Addition to Conv2D, rectified linear unit (ReLU), pooling and dropout unit [4] are used. In classification stage, a fully connected network (FCN) is used. Also, softmax function is attached at the end of the FCN which give us probabilities for each class label.  (Optional) Visualization of the model’s layersConv2D     Figure 3.

Also, we should set up graphs that can execute train step and test step using loss object and optimizer. In train step, we deploy the loss object to calculate the losses and optimizer to adjust weights variables. In test step, we implement loss object to clalulate the performance of the model and no optimizer.  5.

During four months, since I have got an admission offer from UT Austin, people showed different reactions. Some celebrated about entering UT Austin, and others were worried about studying abroad. Former voices, which were louder til I left my home town, become smaller and I got nervous.Everything was going as I planned. The UT Cockrell School of Engineering was one of my dream school, and my registration was also well on it’s well. I had a great time during International Student OT and Department wise OT. Also, I added all the courses I wanted for my first semester. I thought there was no reason for getting nervous or anxious. However, I cannot ignore my anxiety, and it was getting worse as time went by.So I changed my strategy. I started to find out what made me nervous. After a week of figuring out, I found the most plausible reason. It was because of me being impatient with success. It was just a starting point of two years journey. The worst part was that I left the issue after I realized the problem since I did not know how to deal with it.While I was getting tired of this feeling, I read confession of one man which changed my mind. He was a man who just got discharged from the army and trying to settle in where he came from. He said, “I was nervous because I was doing nothing at that time.” At that moment, the words penetrated my heart and made me think, “I should do something, even if it looks not meaningful.” And my answer was to start recording my experience in writing. I believe it allows me to look back at myself and gives me an opportunity to do better next time.This writing is my first step to get rid of my anxiety and improve my school life. Although my first post in UT Austin starts with unfavorable story, I will end up my writing with good news about myself.",
