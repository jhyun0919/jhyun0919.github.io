Whenever I come back to Korea, 떡볶이 has always been the first food that I had. Briefly speaking, this food is just some rice cakes with spicy sauce. Compare to other Korean foods, 떡볶이 might seem shabby. However, this food is one of the reasons why I love and how I remember this place. Why did I pick 떡볶이 instead of other fancy dishes, and why am I so into it? I guess this is because it is my unique way of engraving memories in this country.


Likewise, most people who have not grown up in this country might come up with great landmarks when they imagine Korea. However, as a born and raised person in Korea, the shape of this country in my heart is not like that. It could be the small marketplace in my old hometown, or it could be the parking lot in front of my apartment building, where I used to ride a bike and roller skates. It is kind of a secret between me and the place that I love.

This pattern is identically applied to the people around me. The one who I love (or loved) is not remembered as her bright and shining moments that all the others could have seen. I memorized her in a way that no one could imagine. It does not have to be pretty or lovely. It just needs to be my little secret between her and me. These secrets comfort me and give strength, even though I can no longer be together with her.
