Family, friends, lovers, etc. We form relationships with people as we go through our lives. I, too, live-in relationships with people; some people come closer to me, and some gradually move away.

Some relationships are still with me, and some have already been broken and become a part of the past. Among them, the people I remember having a good relationship with were those who accepted me as I was. Furthermore, they helped me become that kind of person too. In particular, among the words I heard from them, the one that moved me the most was "**You are the person who makes my weakness a strength.**"

Looking back, I think she was able to say those words to me not because I was that kind of person but because she had the courage to show me who she was first and embrace me as I was. In my thought, I was not the person she described. However, her words led me to have an opportunity to become a mature person who cherished the relationship more.

To those who will become close to me in the future, can I accept them as they are and approach me as I am? I may not be able to give a definitive answer to this question right now, but I pray that I could have the courage to share the precious values I have received from those I have had relationships with so far.
