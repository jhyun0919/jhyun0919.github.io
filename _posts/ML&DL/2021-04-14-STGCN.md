# 1. INTRODUCTION

## 1.1. What is the problem?

Transportation plays a vital role in everybody‚Äôs daily life. According to a survey in 2015, U.S. drivers spend about 48 minutes on average behind the wheel daily [2]. Under this circumstance, an accurate real-time forecast of traffic conditions is of paramount importance for road users, private sectors, and governments.

There were many efforts to monitor the current status of traffic conditions and to predict the future. These studies aimed to contribute to widely used transportation services, such as flow control, route planning, and navigation.

<br>

## 1.2. History of previous approaches

Previous studies on traffic prediction can be roughly divided into two categories: Dynamical modeling and Data-driven methods.

Many researchers are shifting their attention to data-driven approaches, since **dynamical modeling** methods have drawbacks as follow. üò°

- It requires sophisticated systematic programming.

- It consumes massive computational power.

- Impractical assumptions and simplifications among the modeling degrade the prediction accuracy.

<br>

As a result, **Deep learning approaches**, which are major representatives of **data-driven approaches**, have been widely and successfully applied to various traffic tasks. Significant progress has been made in following works. üòÅ

- Deep belief network (DBN) [3]

- Stacked auto-encoder (SAE) [4]

However, it is difficult for these dense networks to extract spatial and temporal features from the input jointly. üò°

<br>

To take full advantage of spatial features, some researchers use **convolutional neural network (CNN)** to capture adjacent relations among the traffic network, along with employing **recurrent neural network (RNN)** on time axis. üòÅ

However, this approach has limitations as follow. üò°

- The normal convolutional operation applied restricts the model to only process grid structures (e.g. images, videos) rather than general domains.

- Rrecurrent networks for sequence learning require iterative training, which introduces error accumulation by steps.

- RNN-based networks are widely known to be difficult to train and computationally heavy.

<br>

## 1.3. Proposed Approach

For overcoming the limitations of previous approaches, the author introduces several strategies to effectively model temporal dynamics and spatial dependencies of traffic flow. üòÅ

- To fully utilize spatial information, the author models the traffic network by a general graph instead of treating it separately (e.g. grids or segments).

- To handle the inherent deficiencies of recurrent networks, the author employs a fully convolutional structure on time axis.

Above all, the author proposes a novel deep learning architecture, **the spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks (STGCN)**, for traffic forecasting tasks. ü§ò
<!-- This architecture comprises several spatio-temporal convolutional blocks, which are a combination of graph convolutional layers [Defferrard et al., 2016] and convolutional sequence learning layers, to model spatial and temporal dependencies. -->

# 2. PRELIMINARY
## 2.1. Traffic Prediction on Road Graphs
<br>

#### Traffic forecast as a typical time-series prediction problem

Predicting the most likely traffic measurements (e.g. speed or traffic flow) in the next $H$ time steps given the previous $M$ traffic observations as,

$$
\hat{v}_{t+1}, ..., \hat{v}_{t+H} = \underset{v_{t+1}, ..., v_{t+H}}{\mathrm{argmax}}\log{P(v_{t+1}, ..., v_{t+H} | v_{t-M+1}, ..., v_{t})}

\tag{1}
$$

where $v_t \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is an observation vector of $n$ road segments at time step $t$, each element of which records historical observation for a single road segment.

<br>

#### Graph structured traffic time series problem

In this work, the author defines the **traffic network on a graph** and focuses on **structured traffic time series**. The traffic network is represented as an undirected graph (or directed one) $\mathcal{G_t}$ with weights $w_{ij}$ as shown in Figure 1.

<figure align="center">
  <img src="https://jhyun0919.github.io/assets/img/2021-04-14-STGCN/graph_traffic_data.png" width="400" />
  <figcaption>Figure 1.  Graph-structured traffic data. [1]</figcaption>
</figure>

<br>

At the $t$-th time step, in graph $\mathcal{G}_t = (\mathcal{V}_t, \mathcal{E}, W)$,

- $\mathcal{V}_t$ is a finite set of vertices, corresponding to the observations from $n$ monitor stations at time $t$.

- $\mathcal{E}$ is a set of edges, indicating the connectedness between stations.

- $W \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ denotes the weighted adgacency matrix of $\mathcal{G}_t$.

<br>
<br>

## 2.2. Convolutions on Graphs

<!-- A standard convolution for regular grids, such as images and video, is clearly not applicable to general graphs. There are two basic approaches currently exploring how to generalize CNNs to structured data forms.

- Expanding the **spatial** definition of a convolution [5]

- Manipulating in the **spectral** domain with graph Fourier transforms [6]

The first approach, using spatial convolution, rearranges the vertices into certain grid forms which can be processed by normal convolutional operations.
The second approach introduces the spectral framework to apply convolutions in spectral domains, often named as the spectral graph convolution.

<span style="color:green">
Q. PROS & CONS OF SPATIAL & SPECTRAL???
</span>

<br>

<span style="color:green">
Q. WHY AUTHOR CHOOSE SPECTRAL APPROACHES???
</span>

<br> -->

In this paper, the author introduces the notion of **graph convolution operator** "$*\mathcal{G}$"  based on **the conception of spectral filtering** [7, 8].

$$
\begin{aligned} y & = \Theta *\mathcal{G} x \\& = \Theta (L) x \\& = \Theta (U \Lambda U^T) x \\&= U \Theta (\Lambda) U^T x \end{aligned}
\tag{2}
$$

where

- $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a graph signal as an input (data from each vertex).

- $y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is filtered signal as an output.

- $\Theta(\cdot)$ is a kernel (characteristic of the filter).

- $U = [u_0, ..., u_{n-1}] \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$, Graph Fourier basis, is the matrix of eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian $L$.

- $\Lambda =diag([\lambda_0, ..., \lambda_{n-1}]) \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ is the matrix of eigenvalues of the normalized graph Laplacian $L$.

  (check details of Laplacian matrix in <a href="#appendix 7.1">appendix 7.1</a>)

As a result, a graph signal $x$ is filtered by a kernel $\Theta$ can be defined with multiplication between $\Theta$ and graph Fourier transform $U^T x$ [7].

(check details of graph Fourier transform in <a href="#appendix 7.2">appendix 7.2</a>)

In addition, due to its matrix multiplication, the computational complexity of graph convolution is $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$.

# 3. PROPOSED MODEL

## 3.1. Network Architecture

The author proposed a model architecture called spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks (STGCN). As shown in Figure 2, STGCN is composed of several spatio-temporal convolutional blocks.
Each spatio-temporal convolutional blocks is formed as a ‚Äúsandwich‚Äù structure with two gated sequential convolution layers and one spatial graph convolution layer in between.

<figure align="center">
  <img src="https://jhyun0919.github.io/assets/img/2021-04-14-STGCN/stgcn_architecture.png" width="666" />
  <figcaption>Figure 2.  Architecture of spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks (STGCN). [1]</figcaption>
</figure>

<br>

## 3.2. Graphs CNNs for Extracting Spatial Features

The traffic network generally organizes as a graph structure. Since 2-D convolutions on grids can only capture the spatial locality, attributes of traffic networks (graph structured data) were not fully extracted by 2-D convolution filters.

Accordingly, in STGCN, the graph convolution is employed directly on graph-structured data to extract highly meaningful patterns and features in the space domain.

However, there are two issues of the graph convolution expressed in Eq. (2). üò°

- The kernel is not localized in space yet.

- The computation of kernel $\Theta$ in graph convolution by Eq. (2) can be expensive due to $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ multiplications with graph Fourier basis.


The authors applied two approximation strategies to overcome these issues. üòÅ

<br>

#### Chebyshev Polynomials Approximation

Chebyshev polynomial $T_k(x)$ is used to approximate kernels as a truncated expansion of order $K-1$ as follows.

 $$
 \begin{aligned}\Theta (\Lambda) & = \sum_{k=0}^{K-1} \theta_k \Lambda^k \\ &\approx \sum_{k=0}^{K-1} \theta_k T_k(\tilde{\Lambda})\end{aligned}
 $$

 where
 - $\tilde{\Lambda} = 2 \frac{\Lambda}{\lambda_{max}}-I_n$ ($\lambda_{max}$ denotes the largest eigenvalues of $L$).

- $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a vector of polynomial coefficient.

(check details of Chebyshev polynomials approximation in <a href="#appendix 7.3">appendix 7.3</a>)

Using the Chebyshev polynomials approximation, the graph convolution can then be rewritten as,

$$
\begin{aligned} \Theta*\mathcal{G}x  &= \Theta(L)x \\ &\approx \sum_{k=0}^{K-1} \theta_k T_k(\tilde{L})x \end{aligned}
\tag{3}
$$

where

- $T_k(\tilde{L})\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ is the Chebyshev polynomial of order $k$

- $\tilde{L} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ the scaled Laplacian $\tilde{L} = 2\frac{L}{\lambda_{max}} - I_n$.


As a result, we can localize the filter by restricting kernel $\Theta$ to a polynomial of order $k$.

Moreover, by recursively computing $K$ convolutions through the polynomial approximation, the cost of Eq. (2) can be reduced to $\mathcal{O}(K\|\mathcal{E}\|)$ as Eq. (3) shows [8].

(check details of localizing convolution filters in <a href="#appendix 7.4">appendix 7.4</a>)

<span style="color:green">
Q. RESCALED??? WHY???
</span>
<br>
<span style="color:blue">
A. It makes eigenvalues in the range [-1, 1] to prepare for the recursive computation.

<br>
<br>

<span style="color:green">
Q. WHY |E| IN COMPUTAIONAL COMPLEXITY???
</span>
<br>
<span style="color:blue">
A.
</span>

<br>
<br>


#### 1st-order Approximation

A layer-wise linear formulation can be defined by stacking multiple localized graph convolutional layers with the first-order approximation of graph Laplacian [9].

<!-- Consequently, a deeper architecture can be constructed to recover spatial information in depth without being limited to the explicit parameterization given by the polynomials. -->

Due to the scaling and normalization in neural networks, we can further assume that $\lambda_{max} \approx 2$.

<span style="color:green">
Q. THE SCALING AND NORMALIZATION IN NEURAL NETS???
</span>
<br>
<span style="color:blue">
A.
</span>
<br>
<br>

Thus, the Eq. (3) can be simplified to,

$$
\begin{aligned} \Theta*\mathcal{G}x & \approx \theta_0x + \theta_1(\frac{2}{\lambda_{max}}L-I_n)x \\ &\approx \theta_0x - \theta_1(D^{-1/2}WD^{-1/2})x \end{aligned}
\tag{4}
$$

where $\theta_0$, $\theta_1$ are two shared parameters of the kernel.


In order to constrain parameters and stabilize numerical performances, $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$ are replaced by a single parameter $\theta$ by letting $\theta = \theta_0 = -\theta_1$.

Then, the graph convolution can be alternatively expressed as,

$$
\begin{aligned} \Theta*\mathcal{G}x &= \theta(I_n + D^{-1/2}WD^{-1/2})x \\&= \theta(\tilde{D}^{-1/2}\tilde{W}\tilde{D}^{-1/2})x \end{aligned} \tag{5}
$$

where

- $W$ is renormalized by $\tilde{W} = W + I_n$

- $D$ is renormalized by $\tilde{D_{ii}} = \sum_j{\tilde{W}_{ij}}$.

<!-- Applying a stack of graph convolutions with the 1st-order approximation vertically that achieves the similar effect as $K$-localized convolutions do horizontally, all of which exploit the information from the $(K-1)$-order neighborhood of central nodes. -->
The authors stack the 1st-order approximation $K$ layers vertically. In this scenario, $K$ is the number of successive filtering operations, and the stack achieves the similar effect as $K$-localized convolutions do horizontally.

Additionally, the layer-wise linear structure is parameter-economic and highly efficient for large-scale graphs, since the order of the approximation is limited to one.

(check details of localizing convolution filters in <a href="#appendix 7.4">appendix 7.4</a>)

<br>


#### Generalization of Graph Convolutions

The graph convolution operator "$*\mathcal{G}$" defined on $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ can be extended to multi-dimensional tensors.

For a signal $C_i$ channels $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times C_i}$, the graph convolution can be generalized by,

$$
y_i = \sum_{i=1}^{C_i} \Theta_{ij}(L)x_i \in \mathbb{R}^n, 1 \leq j \leq C_o \tag{6}
$$

with the $C_i \times C_o$ vectors of Chebyshev coefficients $\Theta_{ij} \in \mathbb{R}^K$ ($C_i$, $C_o$ are the size of input and output of the feature maps, respectively).

The graph convolution for 2-D variables is denoted as "$\Theta *\mathcal{G}X$" with $\Theta \in \mathbb{R}^{K \times C_i \times C_o}$.

<br>

## 3.3. Gated CNNs for Extracting Temporal Features

RNNs for traffic prediction still suffer from following. üò°

- time-consuming iterations

- complex gate mechanisms

- slow response to dynamic changes.

On the contrary, CNNs have the superiority as follows. üòÅ

- fast training

- simple structures

- no dependency constraints to previous steps.

The authors employ entire convolutional structures on time axis to capture temporal dynamic behaviors of traffic flows.

This specific design allows parallel and controllable training procedures through multi-layer convolutional structures formed as hierarchical representations.


<figure align="center">
  <img src="https://jhyun0919.github.io/assets/img/2021-04-14-STGCN/temporal_gated_conv.png" width="273" />
  <figcaption>Figure 3. Temporal Gated-Conv Block. [1]</figcaption>
</figure>

<br>


For each node in graph $\mathcal{G}$, the temporal convolution explores $K_t$ neighbors of input elements without padding which leading to shorten the length of sequences by $K_{t}-1$ each time. Thus, input of temporal convolution for each node can be regarded as a length-$M$ sequence with $C_i$ channels as $Y \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times C_i}$.

The convolution kernel $\Gamma \in \mathbb{R}^{K_t \times C_i \times 2C_o}$ is designed to map the input $Y$ to a single output element $[P \: Q] \in \mathbb{R}^{(M-K_t+1) \times (2C_o)}$ ($P, Q$ is split in half with the same size of channels).

As a result, the temporal gated convolution can be defined as,

$$
\Gamma * \tau Y=P \odot \sigma (Q) \in \mathbb{R}^{(M-K_t+1) \times C_o} \tag{7}
$$

where

- $P, Q$ are input of gates in GLU respectively

- $\odot$ denotes the element-wise Hadamard product.

  <!-- - Hadamard product (also known as the element-wise, entry wise or Schur product) -->

- $\sigma$ is sigmoid gate controls which input $P$ of the current states are relevant for discovering compositional structure and dynamic variances in time series.

<span style="color:green">
Q. WHY GLU, NOT ReLU OR SOMETHING ELSE???
</span>
<br>
<span style="color:blue">
A.
</span>
<br>
<br>

The non-linearity gates contribute to the exploiting of the full input filed through stacked temporal layers as well. Furthermore, residual connections are implemented among stacked temporal convolutional layers. Similarly, the temporal convolution can also be generalized to 3-D variables by employing the same convolution kernel $\Gamma$ to every node $\mathcal{Y}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times C_i}$ (e.g. sensor stations) in $\mathcal{G}$ equally, noted as "$\Gamma * \tau \mathcal{Y}$" with $\mathcal{Y} \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times n \times C_i}$.


<br>

## 3.4. Spatio-Temporal Convolutional Block

In order to fuse features from both spatial and temporal domains, the spatio-temporal convolutional block (ST-Conv block) is constructed to jointly process graph-structured time series.

<!-- The block itself can be stacked or extended based on the scale and complexity of particular cases. -->

<figure align="center">
  <img src="https://jhyun0919.github.io/assets/img/2021-04-14-STGCN/st_conv_block.png" width="273" />
  <figcaption>Figure 5. Spatio-Temporal Convolutional (ST-Conv) Block. [1]</figcaption>
</figure>

<br>

As illustrated in Figure 5, the spatial layer in the middle is to bridge two temporal layers which can achieve fast spatial-state propagation from graph convolution through temporal convolutions.

The ‚Äúsandwich‚Äù structure also helps the network sufficiently apply bottleneck strategy to achieve scale compression and feature squeezing by downscaling and upscaling of channels $C$ through the graph convolutional layer.

<span style="color:green">
Q. WHY IT HAS A SANDWICH STRUCTURE???
</span>
<br>
<span style="color:blue">
A.
</span>
<br>
<br>

Moreover, layer normalization is utilized within every ST-Conv block to prevent overfitting.

The input and output of ST-Conv blocks are all 3-D tensors. For the input $v^l \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times n \times C^l}$ of block $l$, the output $v^{l+1} \in \mathbb{R}^{(M-2(K_t-1)) \times n \times C^{l+1}}$is computed by,

$$
v^{l+1} = \Gamma_1^l * \tau ReLU(\Theta^l * \mathcal{G}(\Gamma_0^l * \tau v^l)) \tag{8}
$$

where

- $\Gamma_0^l$, $\Gamma_1^l$ are the upper and lower temporal kernel within block $l$, respectively.

- $\Theta^l$ is the spectral kernel of graph convolution

- $ReLU(\cdot)$ denotes the rectified linear units function.

  <figcaption>Figure 6. The framework STGCN consists of two ST-Conv blocks and a fully-connected output layer in the end. [1]</figcaption>
</figure>

<br>

## 3.5. Loss Function

We use L2 loss to measure the performance of our model.

$$
L(\hat{v};W_{\theta})=\sum_{t}\| \hat{v}(v_{t-M+1}, ..., v_t, W_\theta) - v_{t+1} \|^2 \tag{9}
$$

where

- $W_\theta$ are all trainable parameters in the model

- $v_{t+1}$ is the ground truth

- $\hat{v}(\cdot)$ denotes the model‚Äôs prediction

<br>

## 3.6. Recap of the Main Characteristics STGCN

- STGCN is a universal framework to process **structured time series**.

- It is not only able to tackle traffic network modeling and prediction issues but also to be applied to more **general spatio-temporal sequence learning tasks**.

- The spatio-temporal block combines graph convolutions and gated temporal convolutions, which can extract the most useful **spatial features** and capture the most essential **temporal features** coherently.

- The model is entirely composed of convolutional structures and therefore achieves **parallelization** over input with fewer parameters and faster training speed.

<br>

## 4.2. Data Preprocessing

- Interpolation method: Linear interpolation

- Normalization method: Z-score

<!-- - The weighted adjacency matrix $W$

$$
w_{ij} = \begin{cases} exp(-\frac{d_{ij}^{2}}{\sigma^{2}})&, & i\neq j & \text{and} & exp(-\frac{d_{ij}^{2}}{\sigma^{2}}) \geq \epsilon \\ 0 &, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}
\tag{10}
$$ -->

<br>

## 4.3. Experimental Settings

All the tests use 60 minutes as the historical time window.

$$
\hat{v}_{t+1}, ..., \hat{v}_{t+H} = \underset{v_{t+1}, ..., v_{t+H}}{\mathrm{argmax}}\log{P(v_{t+1}, ..., v_{t+H} | v_{t-M+1}, ..., v_{t})}

\tag{1}
$$

With Eq. (1) and the time window setting, 12 observed data points ($M = 12$) are used to forecast traffic conditions in the next 15, 30, and 45 minutes ($H = 3, 6, 9$).

<br>

#### Evaluation Metric

To measure and evaluate the performance of different methods, three following metrics are adopted.

- Mean Absolute Errors (MAE)

- Mean Absolute Percentage Errors (MAPE)

- Root Mean Squared Errors (RMSE)

<br>

#### Baselines

The authors set up two types of models based on STGCN framework.

- STGCN(Cheb) with the Chebyshev polynomials approximation

- STGCN(1st) with the 1st-order approximation ($K=1$).

<br>

STGCN based models are compared with following baselines.

- Historical Average (HA)

- Linear Support Victor Regression (LSVR)

- Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)

- Feed-Forward Neural Network (FNN)

- Full-Connected LSTM (FC-LSTM)

- Graph Convolutional GRU (GCGRU)


<br>

## 4.4. Experimental Results

#### Benefits of Spatial Topology

Through effectively utlizing spatial structure of the given data, the STGCN based models have achieved a significant improvement on short and mid-and-long term forecasting.

#### Training Efficiency and Generalization

To see the benefits of the convolution along time axis in our proposal, we summarize the comparison of training time between STGCN and GCGRU in Table 3.

  <figcaption>Table 3. Time consumptions of training on the dataset PeMSD7. [1]</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

In order to further investigate the performance of compared deep learning models, the authors plot the RMSE and MAE of the test set of PeMSD7(M) during the training process, see Figure 9.

Those figures also suggest that the models can achieve muchfaster training procedure and easier convergences. Thanks to the special designs in ST-Conv blocks, the models have superior performances in balancing time consumption and parameter settings.

### Step 2. Design the GNN Model Architecture

- The model should able to utilze **spatial** and **temporal** feature of the data.

  - *graph structured* data: spatial feature

  - *time series* data: temporal feature

-  Models based on **STGCN architecture** [1] can extract and learn the both features (spatial & temporal) from the data.

## 7.1. Laplacian & Symmetric normalized Laplacian [10]

<br>

#### Laplacian

Given a simple graph $\mathcal{G}$ with $n$ vertices, its Laplacian matrix $L_{n \times n}$ is defined as,

$$
L = D - A
$$

where

- $D$ is the degree matrix of the graph.

- $A$ is adjacency matrix.

The elements of $L$ are given by

$$
L_{ij}:= \begin{cases} deg(v_i) &\text{if } i=j \\ -1 &\text{if } i\neq j \text{ and } v_i \text{ is adjacent to } v_j \\ 0 &\text{otherwise} \end{cases}
$$

where

- $deg(v_i)$ is the degree of the vertex $i$.

<br>

#### Symmetric normalized Laplacian

The symmetric normalized Laplacian matrix is defined as,

$$
L = I - D^{-1/2} A D^{-1/2}
$$

The elements of $L^{sym}$ are given by

$$
L_{ij}:=
\begin{cases}
1 &\text{if } i=j \text{ and } deg(v_i) \neq 0\\
-\frac{1}{\sqrt{deg(v_i)deg(v_j)}} &\text{if } i\neq j \text{ and } v_i \text{ is adjacent to } v_j \\
0 &\text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

## 7.2. Graph Fourier transform

Graph Fourier transform is a mathematical transform which *eigendecomposes* the Laplacian matrix of a graph into eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Analogously to classical Fourier Transform, the *eigenvalues* represent *frequencies* and *eigenvectors* form what is known as *a graph Fourier basis* [11].

Lets assume we have a graph $\mathcal{G}_t = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E}, W)$, where $\mathcal{V}$ is a finite set of $\|\mathcal{V}\|=n$ verices, $\mathcal{E}$ is a set of edges, and $W \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ is a weighted adjacency matrix.

The definition of Laplacian matrix is

$$
L = I_n - D^{-\frac{1}{2}} W D^{-\frac{1}{2}} = U \Lambda U^T \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}
$$

where

- $I_n$ is an identity matrix.

- $D \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ is the diagonal degree matrix with $D_{ii} = \sum_{j}{W_{ij}}$.

- $U = [u_0, ..., u_{n-1}] \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ is a Graph Fourier basis.

- $\Lambda =diag([\lambda_0, ..., \lambda_{n-1}]) \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues of $L$.

The **graph Fourier transform** of a signal $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is then deinfed as as $\hat{x} = U^{T}x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$, and its inverse as $x=U\hat{x}$ [13].

## 7.3. Chebyshev Polynomial & Approximation [14, 15]

The Chebyshev polynomials are two sequences of polynomials related to the sine and cosine functions, notated as $T_n(x)$ and $U_n(x)$.

$$
T_n(cos(\theta))=cos(n\theta)
$$

$$
U_n(cos(\theta))sin(\theta)=sin((n+1)\theta)
$$

The Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind are obtained from the recurrence relation as follows.

$$
T_0(x)=1 \\
T_1(x)=x \\
T_{n+1}(x)=2xT_n(x)-T_{n-1}(x)
$$

<figure align="center">
  <img src="https://jhyun0919.github.io/assets/img/2021-04-14-STGCN/Chebyshev_Polynomials_of_the_First_Kind.png" width="600" />
  <figcaption>Figure 11. Plot of the first five Tn Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind. [14]</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

One can obtain polynomials very close to the optimal one by expanding the given function in terms of Chebyshev polynomials and then cutting off the expansion at the desired degree.

$$
f(x) \approx \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}{c_i T_{i}(x)}
$$

This is similar to the Fourier analysis of the function, using the Chebyshev polynomials instead of the usual trigonometric functions.

## 7.4. Localizing Convolutional Filter in Space

The Eq. (2) represents spectral filtering of graph signal.

$$
\begin{aligned} y & = \Theta *\mathcal{G} x \\& = \Theta (L) x \\& = \Theta (U \Lambda U^T) x \\&= U \Theta (\Lambda) U^T x \end{aligned}
\tag{2}
$$

The filter is characterized by its kernel ($\Theta(\cdot)$), and the simplest kernerl we can imagine is a non-parametic filter, i.e. the kernel parameters $\theta_k \in \mathbb{R}$  $(k=1, ..., n)$ are all free.

$$
\Theta(\Lambda) = diag(\theta)
$$

In this case, the filter has a limitaion that it is not localized in space. üò°

However, this issue can be solved by following two strategies. üòÅ

<br>

#### A. Restricting kernel to polynomial by Chebyshev approximation (Horizontal ver.)

We can localize the filter in space by restricting the kernel to a polynomial [8]. As a result, the convolutional filter is restricted as a polynomial filter. Moreover, by using Chebyshev approximation, we could limit the radius of the convolutional operation.

The localized filter can be expressed as follows.

$$
\begin{aligned}\Theta(\Lambda) &= \sum_{k=0}^{K-1}{\theta_k \Lambda^{k}} \\ &\approx \sum_{k=0}^{K-1}{\theta_k T_{k}(\tilde{\Lambda})}\end{aligned}
$$

where

 - $\tilde{\Lambda} = 2 \frac{\Lambda}{\lambda_{max}}-I_n$ ($\lambda_{max}$ denotes the largest eigenvalues of $L$).

- $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a vector of polynomial coefficient.

- $K$ is a radius of the convolutional filter.

<br>

#### B. Applying a stack of 1st-order approximated kernel (Vertical ver.)

By 1st-order approximation, we can get a simplified filter as follows.

$$
\Theta(\Lambda) \approx \theta_0 + \theta_1(\frac{2}{\lambda_{max}}\Lambda-I_n)
$$

where $\theta_0$, $\theta_1$ are two shared parameters of the kernel.


Applying a stack of graph convolutions with the 1st-order approximation vertically that achieves the similar effect as $K$-localized convolutions do horizontally, all of which exploit the information from the $(K-1)$-order neighborhood of central nodes [1].
