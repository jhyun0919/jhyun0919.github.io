Starting with the definition of Hessian Matrix, this post will focus on the geometric meaning of Hessian matrix. Also, we will descuss about eigenvalues and eigenvector of Hessian, and introduce the application of the Hessian.

# Hessian Matrix

## Definition
In mathematics, the Hessian matrix or Hessian is a square matrix of second-order partial derivatives of a scalar-valued function, or scalar field. It describes the local curvature of a function of many variables. [1]

Suppose $f : ℝ^n → ℝ$ is a function taking as input a vector $x ∈ ℝ^n$ and outputting a scalar $f(x) ∈ ℝ$. If all second partial derivatives of $f$ exist and are continuous over the domain of the function, then the Hessian matrix $H$ of $f$ is a square n×n matrix, usually defined and arranged as follows; [1]
