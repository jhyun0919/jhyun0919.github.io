Starting with this posting, I am going to upload a series of articles that can help with Python development. The series will be written in four articles, and the contents are as follows, and if necessary, additional posts will be uploaded as a separate series.

1. **Git Basic**
2. [Virtual Environment](https://jhyun0919.github.io/research/cs/2020/10/02/virtualenv.html)
3. [PEP8](https://jhyun0919.github.io/research/cs/2020/10/03/pep8.html)
4. [Jupyter](https://jhyun0919.github.io/research/cs/2020/10/04/jupyter.html)

# What is Git

Git is a free and open source distributed **version control** system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency [1]. It provids us a history of content changes, and facilitates collaborative changes to files [2].

# Why Do We Need Git
When we work on a project and do something creative and productive, we repeat the following four steps [2].

 1. Create things.
 2. Save things.
 3. Edit things.
 4. Save the things again.

By repeating the above steps, we add new things, delete unnecessary ones, request modifications, and make corrections where necessary. In order to make this process clear and efficient, we turn to the help of **version control**. Through the version control system, we can easily track the followings [2].

- When we did it.
- Why we did it.
- What the contents of the change.

This makes it possible to efficiently understand the process of the project, and to be more productive when revisiting the project in the future.

For these reasons, we cannot overemphasize the necessity of version control when working on projects through collaboration as well as personal projects. We can take the benefits of version control through **Git**.

# Basic Git Commands

The following are essential terminal commands for Git. It may be difficult to understand, but it is good to know only its purpose. As long as you understand the purpose of each command, you can easily use Git through the GUI, which will be covered in the following section.

For reference, the contents are referred to the following links.
